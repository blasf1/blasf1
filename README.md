### ðŸ’¬ "The best way to predict the future is to implement it."

I am a PhD student of Advanced Information Technologies with a general passion for Computer Science and Wireless Networks in particular. I work for the better use of resources in Wi-Fi networks. I strongly believe that, if properly used, communications are the engine of humanity's evolution. I want to be part of it by promoting technologies for its benefit.
