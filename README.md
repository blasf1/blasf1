## Hey, I'm Blas!

### 💬 "The best way to predict the future is to implement it."

I am a PhD student in Advanced Computer Technologies with a general passion for Computer Science and Wireless Networks in particular. I work for the better use of resources in Wi-Fi networks. I strongly believe that, if properly used, communications are the engine of humanity's evolution. I want to be part of it by promoting technologies for its benefit. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a better use of resources on IEEE 802.11 WLANs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning and network simulation.
